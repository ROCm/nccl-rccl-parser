# Topology-aware nccl-rccl-parser
This tool is used for dumping out the rccl-tests/nccl-test commands directly from an application to identify any potential bottlenecks of scaling while using RCCL/NCCL modules when running a distributed applications.

To get started please clone the following repository: 
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/nccl-rccl-parser.git

To run the tests, we use the following repositories:

* On ROCm: https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rccl-tests
* On CUDA: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl-tests.git

# Pre-requisites:
* RCCL/NCCL installed. 
* Clone this repo with 
  ```
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/lcskrishna/nccl-rccl-parser.git
  ```
* Run installation script by 
  ```
  sh install.sh
  ```
# How to use the tool:

### Run application and collect RCCL/NCCL Log:**

Firstly, make sure you are running the experiments of a distributed setup of an application.
Make sure to run the application for at least 1 iteration using the below two environment variables into a log file named nccl_debug_log.txt

**On CUDA:**
```
NCCL_DEBUG=INFO NCCL_DEBUG_SUBSYS=INIT,COLL <application> |& tee nccl_debug_log.txt
```
**On ROCm:** (needed for PCIe P2P but not needed for GPUs connected by XGMI, [ref](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rccl/issues/92#issuecomment-540696989))
```
HSA_FORCE_FINE_GRAIN_PCIE=1 NCCL_DEBUG=INFO NCCL_DEBUG_SUBSYS=INIT,COLL <application> |& tee nccl_debug_log.txt
```


### Automated way:

To gather the performance results once you have the debug log with you. Run the below command. 

On CUDA devices, use --cuda argument.

On ROCm devices, use --rocm argument.

With NCCL or RCCL 2.8 or below, the argument "--legacy-device-grouping" is required for device grouping in applications. 

Note: If you don't mention the arguments the automated script only dumps out the output data from the parser. 

**On ROCm:**

```
python run_parser_and_generate_summary.py --nccl-debug-log nccl_debug_log.txt --rocm --legacy-device-grouping
```

```
python run_parser_and_generate_summary.py --nccl-debug-log nccl_debug_new_log.txt --rocm
```

**On CUDA:**

```
python run_parser_and_generate_summary.py --nccl-debug-log nccl_debug_log.txt --cuda --legacy-device-grouping
```

### To run the tool manually step by step:

**Use Parser to dump out the test commands:**

Once the log is being collected, use the parser to dump out all the rccl/nccl test commands or just the unique commands with their respective counts of the workload.
Note: To dump out the unique commands use the --unique argument. 
Note: To dump out the commands for the applications with NCCL or RCCL 2.8 or below use --legacy-device-grouping argument. 
Optional parameters: output-script-name, unique

Here is the usage of the script

```
python rccl_nccl_parser.py --nccl-debug-log nccl_debug_log.txt --output-script-name net
(or)
python rccl_nccl_parser.py --nccl-debug-log nccl_debug_log.txt --output-script-name net --unique
(or)
python rccl_nccl_parser.py --nccl-debug-log nccl_debug_log.txt --output-script-name net --unique --legacy-device-grouping"
```

The first command dumps out all the rccl/nccl tests in the order they get executed in the application. (net_rccl_nccl.sh file).
The second command dumps out a script file with unique commands and a csv file with commands and its counts of each command. 

**Run rccl-tests/nccl-tests:**

Once you dump out the scripts, make sure to copy the script in nccl-tests/rccl-tests folder and run the script and gather the 
Inside nccl-tests/rccl-tests repository:

```sh net_unique_topo.sh |& tee topo_rccl_tests.txt```

Once you run the above script, the performance data of each command is redirected to a text file. 

**Generate Summary:**

Now the final step is to use the above performance log and generate a summary in the form of CSV file for each of the command. The command gives the average values for each command like Time(us), algBw, busBw (out-of-place and in-place). For pytorch please consider out of place options. 

To generate the summary, navigate to the tool nccl-rccl-parser:

```
python generate_summary.py --log-file topo_rccl_tests.txt --output-file-name net_summary --count-file net_counts.csv
```
This dumps out a csv file with performance data for further analysis. 

**Supported Collectives:**

Currently only the AllReduce and Broadcast calls are being supported by this tool. Based on running more experiments other collectives need to be added.
